      2024 has been a great year for Project+ so far, as tournaments have steadily increased in
      attendees throughout the past 9 months. Undertow 2024 is no exception, as the waterpark major
      has locked in 122 entrants for PM, making it the third major this year breaking 120 attendees.
      The entirety of 2023 only peaked at 113 entrants with Mile High Club. So going into the
      stacked event this weekend, who of these 122 players should we look out for?

      After a little bit of time, the idea got floated of using the amazing venue we had to run a bigger event like a regional. I wrote way more about this and how Colorado has grown as a scene in a prior article I wrote for PlusSide about Mile High Club. Before Mile High Club was even over, I had the date locked in for “MHC 2”. 4/20/2024 in Denver, CO. With this new fire inside me, we brainstormed a list of people to reach out to. Some of which were Donkos, Ryzuul, Poilu, and old heads from every state. My work began again.

      If you’ve tried to get into streaming Project+ in the last two years or so, you’ve probably seen or heard of my stream tool. While this old version of the tool was a great starting point for people, I had always wanted to go back and improve on it. Recently, this became a reality - and with this update, a whole slew of features were introduced. That said, I wanted to take some time to go over the changes introduced in the newest version of the tool here.

      It’s been over two years since Honeypot’s inception as a series, with the tournament approaching its sixth iteration this December. Honeypot has become such a mainstay tournament in the Project+ community post-quarantine that many assume it has been a part of the series since the first one. In reality, Project+ made its debut in the event lineup at Honeypot 2, and funnily enough, it has Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl to thank for it.

In past years, the public has generally been left in the dark over the process of rankings, including what events qualify. But in 2023, the PMRank team announced strict guidelines for its qualification process, and for the first time ever, events that qualify for PMRank are known to the public beforehand.

      The spark of resurgence started in Colorado Springs, with CoJoe starting the “Unstoppable” netplay bracket and eventually Valnoir’s house tournaments. Then, it spread to Denver, with Whoratio running the Lone Tree local [which eventually became Wavedash Wednesdays], and eventually spread further throughout the state. From being a side event for other Smash games, changing venues, and now a standalone local and major, P+ has taken a hold of Colorado and started a new era for the mod.

      Hey kids. I’ve been running P+ at Tripoint Smash for two and a half years. If you’ve been in the PM scene for any amount of time (god, we’re all old what happened), you’ll know that’s not terribly long, but I can also count helping out with Bloomington-Normal events, like ISmashU weeklies or running tiny events out of a card shop in La-Salle, Illinois.

      Ah, rankings season. While PM doesn’t do midyear rankings, mostly due to a much lesser depth of events compared to mainline Smash games, seeing those rankings come out always gets me in the spirit. Thus, I’ve decided to take a bit of time to highlight some of the players that have made significant rises over the first part of 2023. This won’t be everyone, of course (plenty of players have made their case for sure), but I’ll cover the most notable ones that I can think of.
